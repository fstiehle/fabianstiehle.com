    Oberstdorf marks the start of our one week Journey. We arrive at around 11:00 on a cloudy day. 
    A quick measurement of my back pack reveals 6.5kg without water. No one should have to carry more than
    8kg across the alps.

    We skip the boring route up to Spielmannsau by taking a short route by bus. 
    We start our ascend to our destination of the first day: the xxx meters heigh Kemptner hut.

    After a short gravel road we set foot on the hiking trail: (stoney) and muddy ground from the rain yesterday

  <p>
  Once we made apx. 1/3 of the track we enter thick fog, 
  the rest walk should be defined by fast currents and waterfalls which we can't see but hear

    After a mere 3 hour walk we arrive at our first destination one thing to read from everyone face:
    "if every day walk will be like this we're in for a stroll". It wouldn't be like that at all.
